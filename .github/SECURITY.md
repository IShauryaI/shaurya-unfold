## Security Measures

### Current Security Practices

- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Code Review**: All changes require review before merging
- **Access Control**: Limited repository access with appropriate permissions
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communications over secure protocols
- **Input Validation**: Proper sanitization of user inputs
- **Content Security Policy**: CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks

### Development Security

- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Secret Management**: No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- **Secure Coding**: Following OWASP security guidelines

## Common Vulnerabilities

### Areas of Concern

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - Input sanitization
   - Content Security Policy implementation
   - Secure data rendering

2. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Automated vulnerability scanning
   - Security patches deployment

3. **Information Disclosure**
