    longDescription: "Captured a stereo chessboard pair and calibrated both cameras to recover intrinsics for 3D mapping. Computed dense disparities with StereoSGBM to reduce noise and fill low-texture regions. Reprojected disparity to real-world coordinates, built an interactive 3D point-cloud viewer colored by left image. Validated mapping by reconstructing the right image from left+disparity and visually comparing against ground truth, documented trade-offs between uncalibrated and calibrated rectification.",
